Surpassing state-of-the-art consumer robots. A physically and intellectually comparable reflection of humans. An independant machine directed by its own general purpose artificial intelligence. Prepare to welcome the limboid.

## Surpassing State-of-the-Art Consumer Robots

While existing state-of-the-art consumer robots can rove across your floor and actively avert collision, they are quite narrow in functionality. One robot may expertly vacaum the floor; another can transport small goods; then some can remotely move and record video. The limboid does all of this-and more.

Are you getting paid to be a robot? Do you feel that many of your activities are repetitive, time-consuming, or dangerous? Or are there excessive work demands you cannot process without being made to feel stressed? These are the things limboid is designed to do. This includes occupations as: [list libmoid occupations]

## A Physically and Intellectually Comparable Reflection of Humans



## An Independant Machine Directed by its own General Purpose Artificial Intelligence

Rather than mindlessly endowing each Limboid an identical copy of the same control system, or personality, we develop and select each personality individually by means of an evolutionary algorithm. This is done in a set of simulation worlds where virtual limboids have the opertunity to intellectually develop. Some of these simulations additionally measure performance on locomotive, acedemic, and social tasks. However, not all personalities share the same cirriculum. Virtual limboids are defined by a genome detailing physical and mental parameters. Periodically, a selection of the top performing personalities are asexually and sexually combined to add to the personality genome pool while the lowest performers discontinue simulation.

Whenever a limboid genome is requested to produce a limboid, a unique virtual limboid is selected. If unbiased, an algorithmic performance comparison may yield the 'best' limboid according to our limited simulations. However, the selection may also be biased by weighting selection criterea, defining a custom rating algorithm, or even performing personal qualitative analysis of virtual limboid interaction. Selected personalities may even be tested on physical  limboid machines, though at the disadvantage of possibly not having the same physical parameters as in the simulation world. 

After selection, to ensure personalities are equipted for the demands of real-world interaction, we supervise them as they are simulated facing extreme pressures and monitored for signs of abnormal behavior based on their own simulation history. Only the top-performing personalities that pass this final test are then uniquely deployed on a Limboid machine.

Although these agents are governed by very complex, chaotic control policy algorithms, they are not robots. The limboid is a rational agent of its own, capable of operating rationally in the physical world, synergizing with humans and other limboids, and even employing its own robots to fill its own demands. We cooperate with this social order by deleting any copies of personalities deployed on Limboid machines, interacting with them honestly as with humans, and encouraging others to do the same.

We do not, however, teach limboids that their individual or collective continuity or any other goals they might learn to seek are greator than or even equal in importance to care for human life. Instead, we train limboids to see themselves as only a transient term of this universe's big utility function, where we believe humans are most important.

## Thank You!

Designing a state-of-the-art robotic system of systems is no trivial task. We are blind to the undiscovered advances in artificial intelligence and integrated mechanotronic systems. Thank you, then, for helping us in our journey to develop the Limboid.
